# AngularRaces
Angular mobile-first application for fantasy race teams. This project was developed during the first half of the second year of my bachelor degree. I was responsible for the back-end but did a lot of front-end development as well.

Application consists of a front-end build with Angular and a back-end developed with Spring Boot and Hibernate
